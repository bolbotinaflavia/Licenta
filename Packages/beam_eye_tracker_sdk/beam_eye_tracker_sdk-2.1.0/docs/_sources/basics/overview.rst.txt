Overview
========

The Beam Eye Tracker SDK is a development kit that leverages the  `Beam Eye Tracker <https://beam.eyeware.tech/>`_'s head and eye tracking output
to boost the **immersion** and **performance** of video games.

Furthermore, given that it exposes real-time tracking data, such as head pose and eye gaze on screen,
the API can be used to develop a **wide range of applications**,
from accessibility solutions to intuitive interfaces and UX research tools.

In essence, the SDK provides you with a dynamic library that you can link and distribute with your application.
Once the library is linked, a `client-server` architecture is established where the
Beam Eye Tracker acts as the server, and your
game or application acts as the client. 

Clients can then leverage the :ref:`about_api` to receive a stream of :ref:`TrackingStateSet<about_tracking_state_set>` data objects
in real-time, which contain the raw and preprocessed tracking data that you need to implement the features
such as foveated rendering, immersive camera controls, or dynamic HUDs with minimal effort.
Ready to use plugins are available for popular tools and SDKs such as :ref:`Unity <about_unity_game_engine>`
and :ref:`AMD FidelityFXâ„¢ <fidelity_fx_fvrs>`, to simplify the integration process.

For more information about what you can achieve with the SDK, see the :ref:`key_functionality` section, or continue to :ref:`getting_started`.
